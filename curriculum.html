    <h5>About Our National Curriculum</h5>
    
    <div class="container1">
        <div class="column1">
            <h5>Pre-primary Section:</h5>
            <p1>The Learning Framework of Uganda (NCDC) for early childhood is for children of ages 3-6yrs. The Framework is outcome and competence based. Emphasis is on learner centeredness and provides for increased learner teacher contact time.<br>

                <br>The school program is result oriented, with observable and measurable skills, knowledge, competences and values to be acquired by the children in the following areas.<br>
                
               <br> Communication and language
                <br>Problem solving and mathematical concepts
                <br>Knowing and understanding of the world
               <br> Physical development/Creative development<br>
                <br>Personal, social and emotional development pervades the entire Pre-primary as the focus is on the development of life skills in all areas of early childhood.
                The children experience the world of IT – computer games, matching and sorting and painting. The school will provide printed stationary/printed activity books for the children to work with.<br>
                
               <br> Time: 8.00 am – 12.00 pm</p1>
               
        </div>
        <div class="column1">
            <h5>Primary Section:</h5>
            <p1> The school also offers Primary education (UNEB) for students  6 -12 yrs,  from P I to P VII with a difference. Today, education has taken on a new meaning, different approaches are merged and integrated to suit a culture and presented to the children to become achievers. <br>

                <br>The curriculum is project based. Good grooming, Eloquent expression, Logic and Reasoning are some of the qualities the primary children will reflect by the time they leave the school.<br>
                
                <br>The Primary section at Toddlers & Tweens is beautifully structured to ensure broad based development of the learners. Here the learners are able to develop their cognitive, social, emotional, cultural and physical skills to the best of their abilities preparing them for their future school career. We believe that proficiency in Language, Arithmetic and Science is an essential condition for continued development.<br>
                
               <br> We are in compliance with the requirement that good development of the learners is an education system that sets challenging targets for everyone of them. Hence we adopt an outcome oriented approach where the learner and school performance is regularly evaluated.
